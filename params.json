The regime came unto power through Executive Order No. 118, dissolving the elected Senate and House of Representatives as well as suspending the writ of habeas corpus and suppression of free speech.\r\n\r\n## Fictional Reportage on a 1:18 scale\r\n\r\nThis is a project I put up to allow for me and my kids to have an activity that we can all enjoy together by working on toy photography, video production and scale modelling.\r\n\r\n## Executive Order No. 118\r\n\r\nThe number 118 is derived from 1:18 scale used on action figures almost similar to size with 3 3/4\" scale G.I. Joe toys from the 80s and 90s.\r\n\r\nThe Philippines was under martial law and a dictatorship for roughly twenty years until it was toppled by a bloodless revolution in 1986. Since then, our youth have entirely forgotten the recent past and is even actively campaigning to restore the former dictator's surviving clan back into power. \r\n\r\nThe fictional plot of E.O. 118 is based on real life experiences and situations from past and current events around the world. It is my way of educating my children on past horrors of having lived under a dictatorship and to make them aware of the possibility of our people once again falling into the same situation all over again.","google":"UA-431457-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
