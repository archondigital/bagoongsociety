	<h2><small>A tribute to: The Diliman Commune, February 1-9, 1971</small></h2>
	
	<p>In February 1-9, 1971, a year after the beginning of the First Quarter Storm, University of the Philippines students, faculty and other personnel, occupied the state university, barricading the main roads leading to the campus. What started as a transport strike, in protest then of the rising price of petrol, quickly morphed into a rally calling for the overthrow of then President Ferdinand Marcos, one year and nine months before he placed the country under martial law and established a dictatorship that lasted until 1986.</p>

	<p>Ang Bagoong Lipunan will publish in the next nine days, image composites using original photos overlayed with 1/18th scale action figures, as part of its fictional storyline, in commemoration of the Diliman Commune.</p>
