PORTA VERDE (MT) -- Government shock troops are often regarded as blank faced, stoic, and mostly uncharismatic. These troops also get to meet a diverse set of people on a daily basis, anyone from the weird to the obscene. In this particular incident, Private first class (E-3) Posadas, a shock trooper from the Ministry of Order and Tranquility, nearly lost his composure as he faced off with rallyists at the Parliament Square last week.

<em>"I was face-to-face with this protester wearing a Capt. America costume, I wanted to laugh my ass off but our CO was just in the line behind us."</em> the private said.

Unfortunately, it wasn't a laughing matter for the person in the Capt. America costume. This story did not end well for him.

<em>"Our CO had the guy arrested and beat up later, poor chap had it comin'... he kept charging us while shouting the 'end is at hand, Hydra is everywhere!', it was priceless."</em> said Posadas.

Government forces continue to exercise maximum tolerance amidst unverified reports of foreigners, leftists and terrorists joining the ranks of the protesters.
