PORTA VERDE (MT) -- "Civil disobedience will only lead to violence", Prime Minister Benito Dusombre said in a statement issued by his office yesterday evening. The brief statement emphasizes that the Republic respects the democratic rights of all its citizens and continues to exercise maximum tolerance towards peaceful protests while delivering a cold warning on those wishing to foment dissent through terrorism and banditry.

The Prime Minister has ordered the Ministry of Order and Tranquility to dispatch crowd control units to secure key government intitutions from falling into terrorists groups who wish to subvert the citizens into armed revolt.

Terrorists operating under the guise of student protesters, were recently able to control portions of the State University after government forces routed them from the central business district last weekend. Crowd control and shock trooper units have since been deployed around the city to prevent the violent protests from further spreading.
