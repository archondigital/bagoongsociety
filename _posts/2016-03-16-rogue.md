NEUVO LEÓN (KP) -- Rogue elements were alleged to have been neutralized by an elite team of rangers and trackers over the weekend in the jungles near the city of Nuevo León. No fatalities were confirmed as of press time and no comment has been made by the Ministry of Order and Tranquility regarding these reports.

Photos leaked to the Kalayaan Post claims these covert operatives who have since gone rogue, were originally sent to terrorize indigineous people, who refuses to abandon their ancestral lands to give way to Global Extratives Inc' mining activities. These rogue units allegedly abandoned their missions and has since sided with the oppressed natives and are believed to have been behind the recent attacks on government patrols in the area.
