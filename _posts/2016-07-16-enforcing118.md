PORTA VERDE (MT) -- Government security forces return fire on progressive elements who have taken control of the House of Representatives' building for the past two weeks following the issuance of Executive Order 118.

The newly formed Bagoong Society Guard (Bravo Sigma), an elite military unit tasked to maintain public order, reports that progressive elements seized control of the legislative building and have placed its occupants, including lawmakers of the recently dissolved Congress under heavy guard, as hostages. Security forces have cordoned the immediate vicinity, preventing rebels from reinforcing their ranks.

Reports indicate that the hostage takers have started firing indiscriminately at civilians and security forces stationed outside. Civilians and foreign press have been recommended to avoid the immediate area for their own safety.
