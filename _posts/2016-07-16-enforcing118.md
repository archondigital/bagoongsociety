Government security forces begin clearing operations at the House of Representatives, which has been illegally occupied by rebels for the past two weeks following the issuance of Executive Order 118.

The newly formed Bagoong Society Guard (BS Guard, callsign "Bravo Sigma"), an elite military unit tasked to maintain public order, reports that progressive elements seized control of the legislative building and have placed its occupants, including lawmakers of the recently dissolved Congress under heavy guard, as hostages. The building has been fortified and booby-trapped and security forces have cordoned the immediate vicinity.

No demands have so far been issued. Civilians and foreign press have been recommended to avoid the area for their own safety.
