PORTA VERDE (MT) -- Government security forces have been tasked to enforce Executive Order 118 as progressive elements took control of the House of Representatives' building following the issuance of the order two weeks ago.

The newly formed Bagoong Society Guard (Bravo Sigma), reports that progressive elements seized control of the legislative building and have placed its occupants, including lawmakers of the recently dissolved Congress under heavy guard, as hostages. Security forces have cordoned the immediate vicinity, preventing rebels from reinforcing their ranks.

Reports indicate that the hostage takers have started firing indiscriminately at civilians and security forces stationed outside. Civilians and foreign press have been recommended to avoid the immediate area for their own safety.
