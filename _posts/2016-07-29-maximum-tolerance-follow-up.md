"The last thing the Republic wants is bloodshed, needless bloodshed. The Republic recognizes the rights of our _legitimate citizens_ and is urging all those who stand for order and tranquility to return to their homes immediately," the Minister adds, "the new order, this Bagoong Society, will set us on the right track."

Government forces and progressive elements have been clashing for weeks now since the Prime Minister issued E.O. 118, placing the entire country under a "new order" as a means to combat corruption and trim down bureaucracy and to contain the religious extremism and terrorism that currently threatens the entire region.
