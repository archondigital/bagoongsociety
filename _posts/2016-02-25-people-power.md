	<p>Our brand of democracy today may be flawed and it is by no means perfect, but it is ours and without it, none of the freedoms that allow us to publish this blog would not have been possible.</p>

EDSA did not happen in our fictional setting. Not yet, since it would've meant the end of our little 1:18 scale universe if we followed these real life events.</p>
