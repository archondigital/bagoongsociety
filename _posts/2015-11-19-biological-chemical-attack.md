PORTA VERDE (MT) -- The explosion that rocked downtown Porta Verde killing 12 and injuring 128 people this Wednesday was a methane gas leak, according to government investigators.

Experts from the Explosives and Ordnance Bureau of the Ministry of Public Order and Safety, dismissed earlier claims that the explosion was caused by a biochemical attack.

"Contrary to earlier reports, our experts have not found any traces of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine in the blast site. Further investigation revealed that the explosion was due to the build up of liquid waste and methane gas in the second basement of the said commercial establishment, though we are not discounting the possibility that it was deliberate." according to Atty. Eurice dela Paz, deputy spokesperson of the Ministry of Public Order and Safety.

"We are looking into possible charges for neglect and for what is deemed as multiple violations of existing sanitation regulations", she said.

"As of today, we have accounted for 12 and identified eight of the casualties and 128 injured. They are scattered I think in two hospitals downtown", Dela Paz, when asked by a reporter from CNN.

The newly formed Bagoong Society Guard (Bravo Sigma), has since deployed 14,000 more enforcers accross the city to maintain order and dispell rumors of destabilization being spread by progressive elements.
