PORTA VERDE (MT) -- Students, faculty and non-academic personel of the State University has occupied campus premises, barricading the main roads leading to it. In what was first perceived as a transport strike, unrelated to the protests ongoing in Parliament Square, the commune as the students called it, has transformed into a call for the adminstration to step down and reliquish power. Government forces were ordered to secure a perimeter around the campus and to immediately take down the makeshift barricades.

	<h3>The Diliman Commune</h3>
	
	<p>In February 1-9, 1971, a year after the beginning of the First Quarter Storm, University of the Philippines students, faculty and other personnel, occupied the state university, barricading the main roads leading to the campus. What started as a transport strike, in protest then of the rising price of petrol, quickly morphed into a rally calling for the overthrow of then President Ferdinand Marcos, one year and nine months before he placed the country under martial law and established a dictatorship that lasted until 1986.</p>
