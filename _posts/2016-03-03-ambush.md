NEUVO LEÓN (KP) -- A convoy believed to belong to the advance party of the recently appointed Minister of Order and Tranquility, Col. Juan Carvajal, has been ambushed on its way to the city of Nuevo León. Fatalities were not immediately known as the Ministry of Order and Tranquility has yet to issue a statement as of press time.

Photos leaked to the paper's staff shows a well-trained and well-armed group behind the attack on the convoy. This comes in light of recent reports of elite military units abandoning their posts and going rogue. [Minister Carvajal][1] was scheduled to speak at an inaguration of a local public library when his advance party was ambushed.

The bustling city Nuevo León, built on top of the state-subsidized mining industry and run by, Global Extratives Inc. or Globex Inc., has recently been the subject of reports of _desaparecidos_, as students and activists protest the forced migration of entire populations of indigineous people.
