PORTA VERDE (MT) -- The Mechaninized Amplified Mobility Platform or _Mech AMP Suit_, which has been in the final stages of field testing will soon be deployed with regular forces after the conclusion of an ongoing full-scale military exercise. The unit has reportedly performed well after being initially deployed with elite units in the past year.

The Mech AMP Suit is an entirely new category of all-terrain, heavy exoskeletal units and is the result of extensive research and development under the Exoskeletons for Human Performance Augmentation program of the Advanced Research Institute (ARI). Powered by a new hybrid fuel-cell & gas turbine engine capable of operating for 36 hours on a single charge/refuel, it packs the firepower and armor of a light tank and is agile enough to run, evade fire and even jump obstacles.

<h4>Tank killer</h4> 

The Mech can attack and disable heavily armored enemy tanks by charging and mounting an attack from above, discharging its primary weapon unto an armored vehicles' lightly armored top side.

Mech units' primary weapons system is the GAU-90 heavy assault gun, a medium-range, 30mm autocannon capable of firing armor piercing, high explosive or depleted uranium rounds at 250 rounds per minute. The GAU-90's secondary weapons systems are composed of an 84mm recoilless rifle capable of firing high explosive anti-tank as well as thermobaric munitions and a flamethrower and chainsaw bayonet which can be employed during melee combat or for clearing obstacles.

Its armor is a combination of lightweight composites and reactive armor effective against most anti-tank weapons. The canopy is impact proof up to 90mm munitions and its cockpit is pressurized and air conditioned inside.

The unit is designed to operate under extreme environmental conditions and can be deployed for chemical and nuclear battlefields. Originally designed for the first manned expedition to Mars and also for commercial asteroid mining, the Mech AMP suit has since found its way into defense contractors curious of how this new technology will fare in the modern battlefield. A non-combatant version is also being developed for engineering roles and will assist the Civil Relations Services in building roads and community centers in counter-insurgency operations.

The Ministry of Order and Tranquility has started to beef up military presence in the ourskirts of Porta Verde amid reports of increased activity of insurgents outside the capital. The Mech AMP suit is envisioned as an effective weapons system that will help neutralize the insurgency both through combatant and non-combatant roles.
