PORTA VERDE (MT) -- Bravo Sigma (BS) Guards were ordered to secure the Central Business District this Saturday as subversives, loot and riot businesses along Main Avenue in what appears to be an attempt at destabilizing the economy.

Rioting and looting broke out at dawn of the Saturday, July 23 in what started as a peaceful march against the implementation of Executive Order 118. Subversive elements, then posing as rank-and-file employees, resorted to throwing bricks and smashing windows of offices who opted not to support their protest action.

The Republic's economy, which has seen robust growth since the issuance of Executive Order No. 118, has shown no signs of weakening as stock trading the following weekday rose by 18,000 points despite the violent protests.
