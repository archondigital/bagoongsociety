Most of Col. Juan Carvajal's is most known for his role as part of an elite unit in the rescue of 42 foreign journalist who were held hostage by Islamic militants at the tarmac of Sierra Madre airport in July of 2006. Most of his exploits prior to 2006 remain highly classified.

He was appointed Minister of Order and Tranquility by the Prime Minister after the untimely death of his predecessor, Norberto Perez. Carvajal's appointment comes amid widespread anti-government sentiment over the issuance of E.O. 118 of which the colonel, as commanding officer of the Shock Troopers, played a key role in its implementation.
